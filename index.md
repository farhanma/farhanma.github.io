## About me

**Postdoctoral Researcher** @
[KAUST's Extreme Computing Research Center](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ecrc)
in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.
  - Working with
  [David E. Keyes](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/david-keyes) on
  developing scalable algorithms exploiting data sparsity in dense matrices to
  bridge between architectures that are increasingly memory-austere on a
  per-core basis and extreme-scale scientific applications.

**Prior to that** - Postdoctoral Researcher @
[UTK's Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://www.icl.utk.edu/) in Knoxville,
TN, USA.
  - Worked with [Jack Dongarra](http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra)
  on developing algorithms for dense linear algebra on distributed,
  GPU-accelerated systems, as part of the world's leading
  [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/) of the United
  States Department of Energy: [Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale
  (SLATE)](https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).

**Before that** - Software Engineer @
[Saudi Electricity Company](https://www.se.com.sa/en-us/Pages/home.aspx), and
Software Engineer Intern @ [Saudi Aramco](https://www.aramco.com/).

## Research

I am currently a research scientist at Google Brain, working on understanding deep neural networks and developing tools for improving the societal impact of AI, mostly around fairness.
